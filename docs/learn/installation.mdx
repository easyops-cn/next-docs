Brick Next has been designed from the start for gradual adoption. You can use as little or as much Brick Next as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of Brick Next, add some low-code capabilities to an HTML page, or start a complex Brick Next powered app, this section will help you get started.

## Try Brick Next

You don't need to install anything to play with Brick Next. Try editing this example!

<NextExample
  files={[
    {
      name: "Bricks",
      code:
`- brick: h1
  properties:
    textContent: <%= \`Hello, \${CTX.who}\` %>`,
    },
    {
      name: "Context",
      code:
`- name: who
  value: world`
    }
  ]}
/>

You can edit it directly or [Fork a project on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/brick-next-try?file=bootstrap.js,context.yml,storyboard.yml).

## Try Brick Next locally

To try Brick Next locally on your computer:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Open [the starter project on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/brick-next-try?file=bootstrap.js,context.yml,storyboard.yml), on the Project panel, press the download button to download an archive of the files locally
3. Unzip the archive, then open a terminal and `cd` to the directory you unzipped
4. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
5. Run `npm start` to start a local server and follow the prompts to view the code running in a browser

## Start a new Brick Next project

To start a new Brick Next project, you can follow the steps above but download [this project](https://stackblitz.com/edit/brick-next-container?file=bootstrap.js).

This enables full features of Brick Next, such as multi-apps and routing.

## Add Brick Next to an existing project

If you want to add some low-code capabilities to your existing project, you donâ€™t have to rewrite it in Brick Next. Add Brick Next to your existing stack, and render storyboards which are made out of bricks.

```bash
# First install the main packages
npm install --save @next-core/runtime @next-core/webpack

# Then install the brick packages you want to use
npm install --save @next-bricks/shoelace
npm install --save @next-bricks/basic @next-bricks/icons
```

```js title="webpack.config.js"
// highlight-next-line
const { RuntimePlugin } = require('@next-core/webpack');

module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
// highlight-start
    new RuntimePlugin({
      brickPackages: [
        '@next-bricks/icons',
        '@next-bricks/basic',
        '@next-bricks/shoelace',
      ],
// highlight-end
    }),
  ]
};
```

```js title="index.js"
import('./bootstrap.js');
```

```js title="bootstrap.js"
import { unstable_createRoot } from '@next-core/runtime';

const container = document.querySelector('#app');
const root = unstable_createRoot(container);

root.render(storyboard, {
  context,
});
```
